This project is still a work in progress and although it has a full release, this is just a personal project. Therefore it may have rough edges and incomplete features.
Feel free to suggest features, provide feedback, or report bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mbrajk/ynac/issues).

### Requirements
- Windows 
- YNAB account w/ a Developer Personal Access Token.
  - Instructions: [https://api.ynab.com/](https://api.ynab.com/)

### Usage (Windows)
- Download the latest stable release [executable](https://github.com/mbrajk/ynac/releases)
- Open Windows Terminal or Powershell
- Navigate to the download folder
- Run `./ynac.exe`
- You will be prompted for your YNAB API token. You will want to save this to the `config.ini` that is created on first run so that you do not need to input it every time
  - This will eventually be automated
- You will be presented with the budget selection options
  - Alternatively you can provide your budget name as the first argument to ynac (e.g. `ynac mybudget`)
  - If only one budget is found it will be opened immediately
- Using the exe from any location
  - Place the executable somewhere on your defined Windows Path or
  - Add the folder where you saved the exe to your Windows Path
